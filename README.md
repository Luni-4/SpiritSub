# SpiritSub

`SpiritSub` is an attempt to build a subtitle editor written in Rust using the `iced` GUI library.

**It is in an embryonic state for now, so it might not work at all.**

**If you are interested in contributing to its development, feel free to send a
PR without hesitation anytime!**

## Why another subtitle editor?

- Single code results in multiple binaries for different architectures and operating systems

- Be safe without discarding the possibility to optimize the code

- Much simpler to extend (maybe xD)

## Building

To build the binary, you need to run the following command:

```console
cargo build
```

## Running

To run the binary, you need to run the following command:

```console
cargo run
